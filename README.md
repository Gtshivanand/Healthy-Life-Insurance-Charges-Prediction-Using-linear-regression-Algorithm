# Healthy-Life-Insurance-Charges-Prediction-Using-linear-regression-Algorithm

This repository contains a project focused on predicting health insurance charges using Linear Regression. The model leverages various health-related and demographic features, such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more, to estimate insurance charges.

# Abstract:

HealthyLife Insurance company has gathered the data regarding the customers and wants to analyze it. Different customers have different lifestyles and hence not all can have the same medical expenditures or requirement of health insurance. To better tailor the insurance package to be given to different customers, the company now wants to integrate machine learning into the process and identify the right insurance charges for each customer. You are hired as a ML Engineer to help the company predict the right charges based on the data that they have been maintaining for each customer.

# Objective:
To create an accurate predictive model for health insurance charges, aiding in better decision-making and understanding cost-driving factors in health insurance.

# Problem Statement:
Predict how much could be the insurance charges for a beneficiary based on the data provided using Linear Regression.

# Dataset Information:

  1. Age - Age of Primary Beneficiary
  
  2. Sex - Insurance Contractor gender (female, male)
  
  
  3. BMI - Body Mass Index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m^2) 
           using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9
  
  4. Children - Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
  
  5. Smoker - Whether the beneficiary smokes or not
  
  6. Region - The beneficiary’s residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.
  
  7. charges - Individual medical costs billed by health insurance (target variable)

# Scope:

  ●	Exploratory data analysis
  
  ●	Data Pre-processing
 
  ●	Training linear regression model with OLS method for prediction

# Conclusion
The project successfully demonstrates the application of the Linear Regression algorithm to predict insurance charges based on health and demographic factors. Through data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model evaluation, the results highlight the significant variables influencing charges. This predictive model can assist insurance companies in making informed decisions, optimizing pricing strategies, and improving customer satisfaction.
