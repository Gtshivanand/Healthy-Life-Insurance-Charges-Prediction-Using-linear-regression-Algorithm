# Healthy-Life-Insurance-Charges-Prediction-Using-linear-regression-Algorithm

This repository presents a project focused on predicting health insurance charges using the Linear Regression algorithm. By leveraging various health-related and 
demographic features, such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more, the model aims to provide accurate estimates of insurance charges.

# Abstract:

HealthyLife Insurance company has gathered the data regarding the customers and wants to analyze it. Different customers have different lifestyles and hence not all 
can  have the same medical expenditures or requirement of health insurance. To better tailor the insurance package to be given to different customers, the company now 
wants to integrate machine learning into the process and identify the right insurance charges for each customer. You are hired as a ML Engineer to help the company 
predict the right charges based on the data that they have been maintaining for each customer.

# Objective:
  To develop an accurate predictive model for health insurance charges, thereby facilitating better decision-making and identifying key cost-driving factors

# Problem Statement:
Predict the expected insurance charges for a beneficiary using the given dataset and a Linear Regression model.

# Dataset Overview
The dataset includes the following features:
  
1. Age: Age of the primary beneficiary.
      
2. Sex: Gender of the insurance contractor (female, male).
      
3. BMI: Body Mass Index, a measure of body weight relative to height (calculated as kg/m¬≤). The ideal BMI range is 18.5 to 24.9.
      
4. Children: Number of children or dependents covered by health insurance.
      
5. Smoker: Smoking status of the beneficiary (yes, no).
      
6. Region: Residential area in the US (northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest).
      
7. Charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance (target variable).
    

# Scope:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding and visualizing the dataset.
    
* Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
    
* Model Development: Training a Linear Regression model using the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method.
    
* Model Optimization: Tuning the model to improve its performance.

# Key Features:

*Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for understanding the dataset
    
*Data preprocessing including handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling
    
*Implementation of Linear Regression for predictive modeling
    
*Model evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score
    
*Visualization of results and model performance

# Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the application of Linear Regression to predict health insurance charges based on demographic and health-related factors. By 
employing thorough data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and robust evaluation techniques, the model identifies significant variables influencing insurance costs. 

This predictive tool can enable insurance companies to:

* Make informed decisions.
      
* Optimize pricing strategies.
      
* Enhance customer satisfaction through tailored insurance packages.
